    operator-sdk init [--plugins=<PLUGIN KEYS> [--project-version=<PROJECT VERSION>]]

<PLUGIN KEYS> is a comma-separated list of plugin keys from the following table
and <PROJECT VERSION> a supported project version for these plugins.

I need to setup a github repo project using this link

https://collabnix.com/docker-container-management-using-docker-universal-control-plane/

write a kubernetes operator using operator sdk to define the direction

//

Schedular (Kubernetes, Golang)
Istio, envoy microservices, and Kong api gateway implementation, improved security for internal CaaS services with network policy
large-scale distributed fault-tolerant middlewares with abstractions, Kubernetes Networking segmentation 

ControlPlane
Kubernetes operator to manage the lifecycle of Universal Control Plane clusters based on the UCPCluster management, including error handling, updates, and deletion of UCP clusters, with service abstraction for managing the underlying infrastructure and networking requirements for a production-ready operator.



and Kubernetes Networking design 
istio...envoy microservices


Kubernetes Operator using the Operator SDK for managing Docker containers via the Universal Control Plane.
adding a controller, implementing the controller logic, building and pushing the operator, Customize the CR and controller to handle specific UCP configurations

ControlPlane
Kubernetes operator  manage the lifecycle of Docker Universal Control Plane clusters based on the UCPCluster custom resource
development to handle all aspects of UCP management, including error handling, updates, and deletion of UCP clusters. Additionally, you may need to implement more sophisticated logic for managing the underlying infrastructure and networking requirements for a production-ready operator.
joining nodes to the UCP, and managing Docker containers.

Developed custom Kubernetes operators to automate complex deployment workflows.
